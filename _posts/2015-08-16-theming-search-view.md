This post will cover how to theme Android's `SearchView`.

1. You're using a `NoActionBar` theme.
2. You're using a dark color for the `Toolbar`s you're including in your layouts.
3. You're trying to style the `SearchView` so that the text color, text hint color, and icons to show your accent color.

Like this. Easy huh? ðŸ˜Ž

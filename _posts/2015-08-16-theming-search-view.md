This post will cover how to theme Android's `SearchView`.

1. You're using a `NoActionBar` theme.
2. You're using a dark color for the `Toolbar`s you're including in your layouts.
3. You're trying to style the `SearchView` so that the text color, text hint color, and icons to show your accent color.

Like this. Easy huh? ðŸ˜Ž

Let's take a look at the default theming, with the `colorPrimary`, `colorPrimaryDark` and `colorAccent` defined.

First, let's remove the `Toolbar` from the theme by switching to a `NoActoinBar` theme, then add on the activity layout.

Switching to `NoActionBar` and moving the `Toolbar` to the layout results in this. _Gross._

So what can we do? Let's start by adding some styles to the `Toolbar`.

Adding the `ThemeOverlay` is a start but still a far cry.

_I'm gonna commit this here and just see how it looks._
